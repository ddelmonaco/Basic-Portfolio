                    Hi im Danisha Del Monaco! I currently reside in Edgewater, NJ. I recieved my associates at BCC in General Professional Studies. I continued my education at NJCU attempting to recieve my BS in Biology, however plans changed. Sometimes the plan that we have in store for ourselves is much different than what is meaant for us. Therefore, here I am starting something out of my elemebt and in all honesty I absolutely love it! 
                    I love photography! Generally I prefer taking pictures of landscapes rather than portraits of individual, of course everyone has their prefernece and for me I feel that I can enjoy the beauty of different things through photograpy. I like to write therefore, for many of pictures I write a story behind it. Photography is amazing because sometimes you would want to wish you could simply go back in time not to chnage anything but to relive a very moment that wa so special, if you just pick up that photo its almost like you are there all over again. 
                    I love cooking! My father was a chef and owned his own frestuarant so im sure thats where my passion for cooking must have came from.
